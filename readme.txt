Kitchen Sync provides a CLI to maintain two folders *nsync across a network using FTP.

There are many alternatives, so why create a new tool? Well, what Kitchen Sync is designed 
to do specifically is:
1. Sync between a PC running Windows and a mainframe running Z/OS.
2. Transparently translate filenames between the two formats. 
3. Run in Python so I can easily "install"/maintain it.
